Minutes of meeting:  
_[Enter Ms]_  
_[Enter Ak, Lu]_  
**Ak:** Now that we have some ideas out in the last meeting, whats the expectation in the project meeting  
    How to refine our project ideas more?  
   **Lu:** Last time we were just getting started so that we are not as lost about the ideas when we meet. we will see where we can go from there.
   There is a genric way to improve on an idea, because it deals with information. Its used in journalism and business strategy etc: 5W1H

**Ak:** I am at part1c. Hoping on finishing the reading and getting started with the unicafe exercise since that is the one which will come next.

**Ms:** Not much. Will continue on the freecodecamp projects.   
  **Ak:** Are you hosting them somewhere? cause I saw you have a portfolio page.  
  **Ms:** yes I will replace some of the projects there   
  **Ak:** I refer to Ms and Lu's Github repo because I wanted to know what all they have done   
      and learn more on how to improve my own codebase.   
      I would go to Lu's gitHub repo after doing my exercises, to see how it has been done.   
      In comparison mine looks ugly at some places  

**Lu:** Doing part 4a... its different than the rest if the course in sense 4th part deals with testing frame works the exercises are slightly lengthy in typing  
    **Ak:** cant we copy paste are there examples in there from where we can do that?  
    **Lu:** They are there but mostly its ~ 30 lines. The exercises when finished will have ~250 lines

**Ja:** Not much from my side. Will resume our work on monday.

[Enter El]  

**Ak:** Us four are done with the standup. So, you can go ahead and start. 

**El:** Ok. Did not do much work coding wise. Just got out from my startup school meeting regarding MVP (most viable product)
    I will post the [link](https://youtu.be/1hHMwLxN6EM) to it later. In group chat.  
    **Ak:** Yes, that will be beneficial for our group project.  
    **El:** I have also been preparing for a session on HTML-CSS blog. There is a diverse
    group which will be attending (children to middle age to old).  
    **Ak:** Is it offline / online cause I would like to join.  
    **El:** It will be Sat Morning 10.30 CT :: local library : so its Sat late night for you 
        just keep in touch with me on Sat evenings.

**Ak:** Anything else that we would like to discuss?  
  **Lu:** Does anyone know about UML?  
    **Ak:** Vaguely remember its used in software design process. It was introduced in my course. Will probably have to 
        refresh my knowledge on it as this was 5 years ago.  
    **Ms:** Vague familarity.  
    **El:** Probably No idea what that is.  
    **Ak:** So, this is where we probably are regarding UML. You can perhaps use simple ones which we'll be able to grasp.  
    **Lu:** Its a good language to communicate complex ideas but if we dont know it, then it will be counter  
        productive in discussions of the projects.  
    **Ak**: ok, looks like we are done here.. thank you guys, see you at the next meetup..
